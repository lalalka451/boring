### 2.3 Resource System
#### Basic Resources (Stone Age)
- **Population** 👥: Workers for buildings (limited by housing capacity)
- **Food** 🍞: Sustains population growth
- **Wood** 🪵: Basic construction material (starts available)
- **Stone** 🪨: Durable construction material (unlocked by Quarry)

#### Advanced Resources (Later Eras)
- **Bronze Age**: Copper, Tin, Bronze
- **Iron Age**: Iron, Coal, Steel
- **Industrial**: Electricity, Oil
- **Information**: Silicon, AI Cores
- **Space**: Antimatter, Warp Cores

### 2.4 Building System
#### Building Categories

2. **Housing**: Increase population capacity
3. **Special**: Provide unique bonuses or effects
4. **Clickable**: Generate resources when clicked (no workers needed)

#### Building Mechanics
- **Cost Scaling**: Exponential cost increase per building
- **Worker Assignment**: Visual +/- interface for worker allocation
- **Efficiency Calculation**: Production = Base × Worker Ratio × Building Count
- **Unlock Requirements**: Era, resources, or other buildings needed
- **Progressive Unlocking**: Stone unlocked by Quarry, Bronze by entering Bronze Age
